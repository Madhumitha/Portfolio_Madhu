        I'm an Engineer, who is always curious about unknown things. 
        I worked as an Assistant Professor for three years.
        I used to teach Digital Signal Processing and Wireless Sensor Network.
        Recently, I contributed for Linux kernel. 
        I love to contribute more as a hobbyist in near-future. 
        I want to become a full stack developer. I'm building skillset for it.  
            </p>
